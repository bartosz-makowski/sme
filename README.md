## Design choices :framed_picture:	
  
**Fonts**

I chose to use the font **Noto Serif** as it was designed to make the web more beautiful across platforms for all languages. This font style is intended to be visually harmonious, with compatible heights and stroke thicknesses. It can be found [here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Serif?category=Serif,Sans+Serif,Display#standard-styles).

**Icons**

Icons used in this project come from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

**Colours**

Using learned knowledge from prior research, bright and vibrant colours have a higher influence in terms of positivity and therefore more potential interactions.
Link to a color palette made using **coolors.co** is [here](https://coolors.co/d8d4d5-03fcba-ee6352-008dd5-f0803c)

## Wireframes :straight_ruler:
I built the wireframes for this project using <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsamiq</a>. Started by doing a very basic wireframe for Mobile/Tablet/Desktop - these were to get a basic understanding of how structurally elements would appear on the page. Wireframes are placed in wireframes [folder](https://github.com/bartosz-makowski/sme/tree/master/wireframes)
